# ToS_LoadingScreens
Addon that allows users to customize what loading screens are shown, more than the default 11.

To install:

- Place the addons folder into your Tree of Savior directory (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TreeOfSavior).
- Either add the addon filepath of this addon to Excrulon's addonloader available here https://github.com/Excrulon/Tree-of-Savior-Lua-Mods/releases/tag/1.7 or use Fiote's addonloader which does it automatically here https://github.com/fiote/treeofsavior-addons
- Add your images into the addons/loadingscreens/ folder, they must be named 1, 2, 3, 4... etc. and in JPG format! I'd suggest keeping them as 1920x1080 too.
